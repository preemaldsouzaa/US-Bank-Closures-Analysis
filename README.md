## Problem Statement
The banking industry in the United States has witnessed a significant number of closures, impacting both banks and the regions they serve. Understanding the dynamics of these closures, their financial implications, and the key factors involved is crucial for industry stakeholders, policymakers, and analysts. However, navigating through extensive data related to bank closures can be overwhelming. There is a pressing need for a comprehensive data analysis project that simplifies the process, providing a clear and interactive way to explore and derive insights from the complex data.

## Objectives:
1. To analyze and visualize the impact of bank closures across the United States using data from the FDIC, with a focus on cities, states, and financial institutions.

2. To identify and present the financial patterns associated with bank closures, including banks with the highest and lowest losses, regional trends, and cities with the highest estimated losses.

3. To provide an interactive Tableau dashboard that allows users to explore the data-driven story, filter data by state, analyze bank closures concerning certificates, and examine the top 10 bank acquisitions.

4. To reveal critical financial insights, including total assets, total deposits, total certificates, and estimated losses, to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the implications of bank closures.

5. To offer valuable insights to stakeholders in the banking and finance sector, enabling them to make informed decisions, understand the factors driving bank closures, and strategize effectively in response to these closures.

## Key Highlights:

1. Developed interactive Tableau dashboards that offer a visually engaging exploration of the data. Users can easily navigate through insightful maps, revealing the cities and states most impacted by bank closures. The dashboards are designed with color-coded insights to highlight estimated losses, making complex data easily digestible.

2. Utilized advanced data analysis techniques to identify banks with the highest and lowest losses. This revealed intriguing financial trends and their implications for the banking sector. My analysis helped stakeholders understand the factors driving these closures and their potential financial consequences.

3. Conducted in-depth regional analysis, focusing on the top 10 states with the highest bank closure ratios. This provided a deeper understanding of regional banking dynamics, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions.

4. Explored city-level data to discover the top 5 cities with the highest estimated losses. Additionally, I examined cities with the highest total assets, offering a comprehensive view of the urban impact of bank closures.

5. Delved into detailed financial metrics, including total assets, total deposits, total certificates, and estimated losses. This allowed me to uncover critical financial insights that could guide strategic decisions in the banking and finance sector.

## Why This Matters:
My project holds immense significance for the banking and finance industry. It sheds light on the factors driving bank closures and offers a comprehensive view of their financial implications. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for stakeholders aiming to make informed decisions and strategize effectively.

## How to Explore:
The project's interactive Tableau dashboards provide an engaging and user-friendly experience. Users can easily navigate the data-driven story by applying filters to explore data by state, assess bank closures concerning certificates, and examine the top 10 bank acquisitions.

## Tools Used:
I proficiently used Excel for data preprocessing, ensuring that the data was clean and ready for analysis. For data visualization, I leveraged Tableau to create intuitive and informative dashboards that effectively conveyed the project's insights.

## Dashboards:

#### 1. Cities and States Impacted by Bank Closures
![Cities   States Impacted by Bank Closures](https://github.com/preemaldsouzaa/US-Bank-Closures-Analysis/assets/117831091/24b97ffe-367e-4b92-857a-030ea25fbb01)

The above dashboard offers a compelling visual representation of the consequences of bank closures across cities and states in the United States. Employing Tableau's dynamic mapping capabilities, this dashboard provides an at-a-glance understanding of the geographic distribution of bank closures. Through color grading, viewers can quickly discern the severity of closures in various regions. The dashboard excels in identifying top impacted cities, which are clearly distinguished by distinct colors or shading. Furthermore, it may offer interactive filtering options for users to explore the data based on specific criteria. Ultimately, this dashboard empowers stakeholders to gain critical insights into the spatial patterns and trends of bank closures, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning in the realm of finance.


#### 2. Dashboard 2

Dashboard above is a multifaceted visualization hub that delves into key aspects of bank closures in the United States. It begins by spotlighting the financial performance of banks affected by these closures. Two contrasting categories are emphasized: the "Top Banks with Highest Losses" and the "Top Banks with Lowest Losses." In the former, banks such as Silicon Bank, Indymac Bank, Bank United FSB, Signature Bank, and Colonial Bank are singled out, painting a picture of those most severely impacted.

Shifting the focus, the dashboard then transitions into a geographic perspective. It elucidates the regional trends associated with bank closures, offering insight into the "Top 10 States with the Highest Closure Rate." States like Georgia, Florida, Illinois, California, and Minnesota emerge as prominent players in this arena, among others.

Moreover, I have incorporated a heatmap visualization of cities deeply affected by bank closures. Cities like Santa Clara, Pasadena, Coral Gables, Atlanta, and New York are particularly highlighted. This detailed city-level analysis adds granularity to the overarching narrative, allowing viewers to discern localized patterns in bank closures.

#### 3. Dashboard 3

Dashboard 3 paints a vivid portrait of the American banking landscape through a quartet of illuminating charts and tables. At its heart, the Bubble Chart showcases cities with the highest total assets, with Henderson at the forefront, boasting a staggering $309 billion. San Francisco follows closely, wielding $226 billion in financial clout, while Santa Clara and New York round out this league of financial giants with $209 billion and $111 billion, respectively. 

The accompanying tables delve deeper into the banking industry, offering insights into bank names paired with their total assets and deposits. Here, stalwarts like Washington Mutual Bank, First Republic Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and IndyMac Bank shine, consistently demonstrating their financial prowess. 

Lastly, the Distribution of Bank Closures by Closing Date chart unfolds that the highest number of bank closures occurred in the year 2010, surpassing 150 closures. Interestingly, the data reflects a gradual increase in closures starting from 2007, followed by a gradual decrease after 2010. 

This rich array of data serves as a valuable toolkit for comprehending the intricate dynamics of American banks, their assets, deposits, and closures.

#### 4. Bank Closure wrt State

Dashboard 4 emerges as a robust analytical toolkit, providing a comprehensive exploration of bank closures with a powerful state filter at its core. This dropdown filter empowers users to precisely navigate through data, focusing their attention on specific states of interest.

The first chart sets the stage, offering an overview of bank closures in relation to certificates. It serves as a foundational element for understanding broader trends.

The second chart delves into the intricate world of mergers and acquisitions, presenting an interactive table that unveils crucial details about the top 10 bank acquisitions. This table supplies users with essential information including the acquiring institution, bank name, total assets, and total deposits involved in these financial transactions. Such insights prove invaluable in deciphering the financial impact of these acquisitions.

Complementing these informative charts are a series of indispensable data cards, each presenting essential metrics. These metrics encompass total assets, total estimated losses, total deposits, total certificates, and the overall count of closed banks. These cards offer quick-reference points for users seeking key figures at a glance.

This dynamic dashboard, fortified by the inclusion of the state filter, grants users the ability to tailor their exploration of bank closures to specific states, making it an invaluable resource for dissecting the financial dynamics of closures across the United States.
